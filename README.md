# GPower: Power Modeling Framework for Gem5

---

## Introduction

GPower is a power modeling framework for Gem5. It provides a set of power models that can be used to model the power consumption of a simulated system. The power models are based on the work of researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of California, Berkeley.
